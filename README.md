# Sentiment-Analysis
As my contribution to the capstone project for "1millionteachers", I did the data preprocessing part where I cleaned and pre-processed the textual data extracted from the social media pages of the organization to do a sentiment analysis on their services on which customers are giving their feedback so that we can categorize their responces in terms of positive, negative and neutral polarity. In this way, company can identify the areas of services that needs an improvement.
